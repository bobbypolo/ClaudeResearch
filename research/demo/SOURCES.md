## Tier Distribution
- **Tier 1** (Peer-reviewed): 0 (0%) - Field too recent
- **Tier 2** (Preprints + Authoritative practitioner): 14 (93%)
- **Tier 3** (Industry blogs): 1 (7%)

*Note: Tier distribution adjusted due to recency of RAG research (2022-2025). arXiv preprints from credentialed authors treated as Tier 2.*

## Filtered (excluded)

| Title | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| 36 sources | Below top 5 per unit or redundant coverage |
| Medium articles (4) | Tier 3, lower authority |
| Video content (1) | Not extractable |

## Curation Notes

1. **Academic sources prioritized** for foundational claims
2. **Microsoft/NVIDIA/Snowflake** practitioner sources retained for production insights
3. **LangChain/LlamaIndex** docs kept for implementation guidance
4. **No duplicates found** between academic and practitioner discovery
