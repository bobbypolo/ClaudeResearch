## Notes

1. **Source Quality:** arXiv preprints dominated results due to recency of RAG research (most significant work 2023-2025). Many papers are from top venues (ACL, NeurIPS workshops) or established research groups (Microsoft, Meta AI).

2. **Gaps Identified:**
   - Limited peer-reviewed journal articles (field is too recent)
   - Few systematic benchmarking studies comparing all RAG components together
   - Sparse coverage of production deployment experiences

3. **Key Foundational Papers:**
   - Lewis et al. (2020) - Original RAG paper (predates search window but cited by all)
   - Karpukhin et al. (2020) - Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) foundation

4. **Tier Distribution:**
   - Tier 1 (Peer-reviewed): ~15%
   - Tier 2 (arXiv with credentialed authors): ~80%
   - Tier 3: ~5%
