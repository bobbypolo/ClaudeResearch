## Notes

1. **arXiv Rate Limiting**: Direct arXiv searches were blocked due to API rate limits. Alternative coverage obtained through OpenAlex which indexes arXiv preprints.

2. **Coverage Gaps**:
   - Limited direct "same-game parlay" academic literature (industry-specific term)
   - Few papers specifically on "closing line value" (practitioner terminology)
   - Copula models in sports context are sparse; general copula literature exists

3. **Strong Coverage**:
   - Kelly criterion and portfolio optimization well-documented
   - Market efficiency and bookmaker pricing extensively studied
   - ML prediction models comprehensively reviewed

4. **Tier Distribution**:
   - Tier 1 (peer-reviewed journals): ~70%
   - Tier 2 (preprints, working papers): ~25%
   - Tier 3 (industry): ~5%

5. **Recency**: 75% of papers are from 2015-2024, with foundational exceptions for Kelly criterion and market efficiency theory.
