- **Type**: ACADEMIC
- **Tier**: 1
- **Extraction depth**: FULLTEXT
- **Source URL**: https://doi.org/10.5750/jpm.v9i1.987
- **Sections extracted**: Abstract, Theoretical Framework, Mathematical Derivations, Implications
- **Main claim**: Bookmaker profitability can be mathematically modeled as a function of wagers placed and margin structure, with accumulator bets generating disproportionately higher margins.
- **Key evidence**: "Odds set by bookmakers should have implied probabilities that add up to at least one, otherwise arbitrage is present." The study establishes that bookmakers can "increase profitability by offering more multiples, also known as accumulators" and "lower variation in payouts by maintaining the ratio of wagers and implied probability per outcome." (Theoretical Framework)
- **Limitations**: Theoretical framework; does not account for market liquidity or line movement dynamics.
- **Relevance**: Sportsbook pricing - margin estimation
- **Notes**: Foundational paper for understanding bookmaker mathematics; demonstrates why parlay products have systematically higher hold percentages.

- **Type**: ACADEMIC
- **Tier**: 1
- **Extraction depth**: FULLTEXT
- **Source URL**: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216876
- **Sections extracted**: Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion
- **Main claim**: Complex betting products advertised during live events carry substantially higher margins than simple bets, exploiting consumer probability assessment limitations.
- **Key evidence**: "Average decimal odds: 7.4" with "house margin for complex bets substantially exceeded traditional soccer wagers." First/next goalscorer bets showed margins of "32.3%-34.6% versus 5-6% for basic home-draw-away bets." Correct-score bets demonstrated margins of "21.9%-23.2%." Study found "soccer fans produced probability assessments of 279-306% for correct-score events (incoherent predictions exceeding 100%)." (Results section)
- **Limitations**: UK market specific; advertising study rather than pure pricing analysis.
- **Relevance**: Sportsbook pricing - margin differential by bet complexity
- **Notes**: Quantitative evidence that complex bets (relevant to SGP) carry 5-7x higher margins than simple bets.

- **Citation**: Snowberg, E., & Wolfers, J. (2010). Explaining the Favorite-Longshot Bias: Is it Risk-Love or Misperceptions? *Journal of Political Economy*, 118(4), 723-746.
- **Type**: ACADEMIC
- **Tier**: 2 (NBER Working Paper)
- **Extraction depth**: FULLTEXT
- **Source URL**: https://doi.org/10.3386/w15923
- **Sections extracted**: Abstract, Introduction, Theoretical Framework, Empirical Tests, Conclusions
- **Main claim**: The favorite-longshot bias is primarily driven by probability misperceptions (as suggested by Prospect Theory) rather than rational risk-loving preferences.
- **Key evidence**: "The favorite-longshot bias describes the longstanding empirical regularity that betting odds provide biased estimates of the probability of a horse winning--longshots are overbet, while favorites are underbet." Study tests competing theories by examining compound bets (exacta, quinella, trifecta pools) and finds "evidence in favor of the view that misperceptions of probability drive the favorite-longshot bias." (Abstract and Conclusions)
- **Limitations**: Horse racing focus; transferability to other sports requires validation.
- **Relevance**: Sportsbook pricing - understanding pricing biases
- **Notes**: FOUNDATIONAL. 473 citations. Critical for understanding why certain bet types are systematically mispriced; probability weighting function distortions apply to parlay pricing.

- **Extraction depth**: FULLTEXT
- **Source URL**: https://doi.org/10.3386/w10504
- **Sections extracted**: Abstract, Introduction, Information Aggregation, Market Design, Conclusions
- **Main claim**: Well-designed prediction markets efficiently aggregate dispersed information into accurate probability forecasts that outperform most benchmarks.
- **Key evidence**: "Market-generated forecasts are typically fairly accurate, and they outperform most moderately sophisticated benchmarks. Carefully designed contracts can yield insight into the market's expectations about probabilities, means and medians, and also uncertainty about these parameters." By election day, "markets with an average absolute error of around 1.5 percentage points, were considerably more accurate" than alternatives. (Abstract)
- **Limitations**: Focus on political/economic prediction markets rather than sports betting specifically.
- **Relevance**: Sportsbook pricing - market efficiency theory
- **Notes**: FOUNDATIONAL. 1,982 citations. Establishes theoretical basis for treating closing lines as efficient probability estimates; supports CLV methodology.

- **Main claim**: Systematic pricing differences between wholesale (sharp) and retail (recreational) sportsbooks create exploitable arbitrage opportunities for informed bettors.
- **Key evidence**:

| Metric | Wholesale Sportsbook | Retail Sportsbook |

- **Limitations**: Practitioner source; qualitative observations rather than rigorous academic study.
- **Relevance**: Sportsbook pricing - sharp vs recreational pricing differential
- **Notes**: Practical quantification of the wholesale-retail spread; critical for understanding where edge can be found.

## Key Findings Summary

### Margin Structures
1. **Simple bets**: 5-6% margin (home-draw-away)
2. **Complex bets**: 21-34% margin (goalscorer, correct score)
3. **Sharp books**: 2.38% vig (-105 lines)
4. **Retail books**: 4.55% vig (-110 lines)

### Pricing Biases
- Favorite-longshot bias driven by probability misperception, not risk preferences
- Public sentiment creates exploitable inefficiencies in recreational books
- Accumulator/parlay products carry disproportionately higher margins

### Market Efficiency
- Closing lines at sharp books approximate efficient probability estimates
- Information aggregation occurs through price discovery mechanism
- Line movement from sharp money provides signal of true probability

### Implementation Implications
- Access to sharp book prices essential for edge identification
- Complex bet products (SGP) inherently carry higher theoretical vig
- Break-even win rate difference (51.22% vs 52.38%) is substantial for long-term profitability
