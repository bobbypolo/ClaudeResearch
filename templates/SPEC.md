# Research Specification: [Topic]

## Goal
<!-- REQUIRED: What you want to accomplish (in implementation terms, not as a question) -->
<!-- Use action verbs: Build, Design, Implement, Create, Develop -->
Build/Design/Implement [specific outcome or system]

## Success Criteria
<!-- REQUIRED: What HIGH confidence looks like for this research -->
<!-- These become the completion gate requirements -->
- [ ] Specific method recommendations identified for each component
- [ ] Implementation sequence with dependencies defined
- [ ] Data requirements documented
- [ ] Known risks paired with mitigations from failure studies
- [ ] Validation approach specified with target metrics

## Research Units
<!-- REQUIRED: 1-5 focused areas of investigation -->
<!-- Frame as components to build, not questions to answer -->
1. [Component/method area 1]
2. [Component/method area 2]
3. [Component/method area 3]

## Deliverable
<!-- REQUIRED: Choose ONE primary deliverable type -->
<!-- SPECIFICATION is the new default for "how to build" goals -->
- **SPECIFICATION**: Implementation blueprint with method selections, data requirements, risk-mitigation table (DEFAULT)
- **VERDICT**: Recommendation with comparison matrix (use for "which should I use" decisions)
- **COMPARISON**: Neutral side-by-side analysis (use for "compare X vs Y")
- **REPORT**: Comprehensive findings by research unit (use for "what is X" questions)
- **BLUEPRINT**: Architecture/design specification (use for high-level design)
- **BIBLIOGRAPHY**: Annotated source list (use for literature reviews)

**Primary Deliverable**: SPECIFICATION

## Context
<!-- REQUIRED: Your specific situation -->
- **Use case**: [What you're trying to build/accomplish]
- **Constraints**: [Technical, budget, timeline, data limitations]
- **Expertise**: [Your team's relevant background and capabilities]
- **Existing work**: [What you've already tried or know about]

## Prior Art Hints
<!-- OPTIONAL: Known starting points to seed the research -->
<!-- These help focus initial discovery -->
- [Paper, system, or method you know about]
- [Domain expert or research lab to look for]
- [Related work from adjacent fields]

## Constraints
<!-- OPTIONAL: Research boundaries -->
- Time period: Last 5 years (foundational works always included)
- Evidence types: Academic preferred, practitioner sources acceptable
- Excluded: [Any sources, methods, or perspectives to skip]

## Key Search Terms
<!-- OPTIONAL: Auto-generated from Goal and Research Units if not provided -->
- "[primary term]"
- "[synonym or variant]"
- "[related concept]"

## Recency Policy
<!-- OPTIONAL: Controls how aggressively to prefer recent sources -->
<!--
  fast_moving: Prioritize sources from last 2 years.
               Use for: AI/ML, LLMs, crypto, emerging tech.
               Example: "Build an LLM-based classification system"

  scientific:  Standard 5-year window. Balance recency with citations.
               Use for: Established scientific fields, engineering.
               Example: "Build a Bayesian inference system for sensor data"

  historical:  No recency preference. Foundational works equally weighted.
               Use for: Philosophy, history, fundamental algorithms.
               Example: "Implement classical optimization algorithms"
-->
**Recency**: scientific

<!-- OPTIONAL: Preset hint for workflow tuning -->
<!-- Preset: quick | standard | thorough | decision-support -->
<!-- quick (2 sources/unit) | standard (3) | thorough (5) | decision-support (4) -->
