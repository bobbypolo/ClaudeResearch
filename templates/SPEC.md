# Research Specification: [Topic]

## Research Question
<!-- REQUIRED: One clear question this research must answer -->
What is the current state of [topic]?

## Research Units
<!-- REQUIRED: 1-5 focused areas of investigation -->
1. [First area to investigate]
2. [Second area to investigate]
3. [Third area to investigate]

## Deliverables
<!-- REQUIRED: Choose ONE primary deliverable type -->
- **VERDICT**: Recommendation with comparison matrix (use for "which should I use" questions)
- **REPORT**: Comprehensive findings by research unit (use for "what is" questions)
- **COMPARISON**: Neutral side-by-side analysis (use for "compare X vs Y" questions)
- **BLUEPRINT**: Architecture/design specification (use for "how to design" questions)
- **BIBLIOGRAPHY**: Annotated source list (use for literature reviews)

**Primary Deliverable**: REPORT

## User Context
<!-- REQUIRED: Your specific situation -->
- **Use case**: [What are you trying to accomplish?]
- **Constraints**: [Technical, budget, timeline limitations]
- **Expertise**: [Your team's relevant experience]

## Constraints
<!-- OPTIONAL: Defaults to "last 5 years + foundational works" -->
- Time period: Last 5 years (foundational works always included)
- Evidence types: Academic preferred, practitioner sources acceptable
- Excluded: [Any sources or perspectives to exclude]

## Key Search Terms
<!-- OPTIONAL: Auto-generated if not provided -->
- "[primary term]"
- "[synonym or variant]"
- "[related concept]"

## Recency Policy
<!-- OPTIONAL: Controls how aggressively to prefer recent sources -->
<!--
  fast_moving: Prioritize sources from last 2 years. Older sources need strong justification.
               Use for: AI/ML, cybersecurity, cloud technologies, social media trends.
               Example: "What are current best practices for LLM fine-tuning?"

  scientific:  Standard 5-year window. Balance recency with citation count.
               Use for: Established scientific fields, medical research, engineering.
               Example: "What are effective treatments for condition X?"

  historical:  No recency preference. Foundational works equally weighted.
               Use for: Philosophy, history, legal analysis, long-term trends.
               Example: "What are the key theories of organizational behavior?"
