# Research Plan: [Topic]

## Goal Understanding
<!-- Restate the user's goal in implementation terms -->
The objective is to [specific implementation outcome].

## Success Criteria
<!-- What HIGH confidence looks like for this research -->
- [ ] Specific method recommendations identified for each component
- [ ] Implementation sequence with dependencies defined
- [ ] Data requirements documented
- [ ] Known risks paired with mitigations
- [ ] Validation approach with target metrics specified

## Research Strategy

### Unit 1: [Component/Area Name]
**Question**: How do we [specific aspect]?
**Search Strategy**:
- Primary: "[term] implementation" "[term] method" "[term] algorithm"
- Secondary: "[term] architecture" "[term] system design"
- Failure: "[term] failed" "[term] pitfalls" "[term] lessons learned"
**Expected Sources**: [papers, technical reports, case studies]
**Success Indicator**: [what finding HIGH confidence looks like]

### Unit 2: [Component/Area Name]
**Question**: How do we [specific aspect]?
**Search Strategy**:
- Primary: "[term] implementation" "[term] method"
- Secondary: "[term] comparison" "[term] benchmark"
- Failure: "[term] mistakes" "[term] what went wrong"
**Expected Sources**: [papers, documentation]
**Success Indicator**: [what finding HIGH confidence looks like]

### Unit 3: [Component/Area Name]
**Question**: How do we [specific aspect]?
**Search Strategy**:
- Primary: "[term] best practices" "[term] state of the art"
- Secondary: "[term] evaluation" "[term] validation"
- Failure: "[term] failure modes" "[term] edge cases"
**Expected Sources**: [papers, industry reports]
**Success Indicator**: [what finding HIGH confidence looks like]
